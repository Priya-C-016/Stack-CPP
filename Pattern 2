2. Histogram Based Area Problems
Use stack to maintain increasing heights.

Pattern: Push index while current height >= height[stack.top()]

When lower height appears, pop and calculate area.

Add sentinel (0) to force final computation.

Examples:

Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Max Rectangle in Binary Matrix (row by row histogram)
