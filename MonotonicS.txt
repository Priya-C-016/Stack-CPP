🔍 How It Works:
Stack stores indices of elements in decreasing order of their values.

When a new element is greater, we found the next greater element for the elements popped from the stack.

📌 Want variations?
🔄 Previous Greater Element? → Loop from right to left

🔄 Next Smaller Element? → Change comparison to <

🧠 Histogram Area? → Use monotonic stack to track boundaries
