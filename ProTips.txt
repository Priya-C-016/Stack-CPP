 5. Stack with State / Custom Object
Each stack element stores extra data â€” like index, count, min, etc.

Pattern: Stack of pairs or structs

Used in problems that require remembering more than just values

Examples:

Asteroid Collision

Remove K Digits

Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (stack of numbers)

ðŸ”¹ 6. Simulation with Stack
Simulate actual system behavior like browser history, function calls, or undo operations.

Examples:

Implement Queue using Stacks

Exclusive Time of Functions

Evaluate Expression with Precedence

ðŸ”¹ 7. Two-Pass Stack Approach
Sometimes, you need to process left-to-right and right-to-left using a stack.

Examples:

Trapping Rain Water

Largest Rectangle in Binary Matrix

ðŸ§  Tips to Master Stack Problems:
Visualize the stack at every step â€” draw or print it out.

Use indexes when needed, especially in NGE/Histogram problems.

Recognize monotonic stack situations â€” increasing or decreasing order.

Think about whether your stack needs to track extra state (like min, index, count).

For string problems â€” check for matching conditions, not just characters.
